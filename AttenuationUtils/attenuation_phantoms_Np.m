% DESCRIPTION: Define attenuation of References Phantoms for the RPM Method
% INPUT:
%        - FREQ: Vector of frequencies in [MHz]
%        - CHOICE: Type of phantom
%                 - 1 :  phantom "low attenuation"
%                 - 2 :  phantom "high attenuation" 
%                 - 3 :  phantom 3 - "Agar" Referenced in Journal Rouyer TUFFC*
%                 - 4 :  phantom 4 - "Agar & Milk"
%                 - 5 :  high attenuation phantom using Madsen values - spline interpolation
%                 - 6 :  new low att phantom using Madsen values
%                 - 111 : linear attenuation dependence, add SLOPE (usually k-wave simulation)
%                 - 222 : power attenuation dependence, COILA EXVIVO (usually k-wave simulation)
%        - SLOPE: Slope for linear dependency CHOICE = 111 [dB/cm-MHz]
% OUTPUT: 
%     - ATT: Attenuation as function of frequency in [Np/cm]
